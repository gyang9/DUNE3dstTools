# Debugging Display for CubeRecon

This is a simple debugging display to help visually validate the
output.  It's not a full (real) event display!  It's included because
it can be very helpful for getting a handle on what is going on in an
event, but is not a substitute for a real display.

This expects a root file produced by the CubeRecon.

## Running

This can be run using "cube-disp <input-file>".  Or as "cube-disp -h" to
get a list of the command line parameters.
